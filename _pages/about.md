I am currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Informatics with a specialization in Engineering Software-Intensive Systems at [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/). My academic foundation was established at [Ko√ß University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/) where I completed dual B.Sc. degrees in Industrial Engineering and Computer Science with a track program in Artificial Intelligence, graduating Magna Cum Laude with honors.

Alongside my studies, I have gained valuable professional experience at leading organizations including [BMW Group](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en.html) and [EY](https://www.ey.com/), where I've contributed to diverse projects spanning data analytics, software engineering, and process optimization. My work encompasses designing scalable data pipelines, engineering cloud environments, developing web applications, and implementing full-stack solutions that bridge theoretical concepts with practical business challenges.

In my master's thesis, "A Resilient Matrix Assembly Layout Design for Mixed-Model Vehicle Production," I formulated one of the first stochastic optimization models to address task-level disruptions in automotive manufacturing. This work contributed to the literature by introducing the Resilient Matrix Assembly Layout Problem, demonstrating significant reconfiguration cost reductions compared to traditional static models and highlighting the value of proactive disruption-aware planning.

My interest lies in combining analytical problem-solving with a strong technical background to create meaningful and lasting impact.
